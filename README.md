This is the blog i am working on using nodejs. This is intended for learning so use at your own risk.

#### Required Packages

You will need to install the following packages in addition to node js.

: Express V 2
: jshtml V 0.2

The simpelest way to do this would be with npm

	npm install express@2
	npm install jshtml@0.2
