<p>Home of half-baked concepts and prototype designs focused on good coding practice and new (to me) languages</p>

<hr /><h3>2013-03-26</h3>
<p>Official release date of the 0xbadc0de website. This is marks my first project using nodejs. I am excited to see where this goes.</p>

<hr /><h3>Thank you for visting 0xBADC0DE.</h3>
<p>This blog is a collection of half-baked concepts and prototype designs for things which i am interested. Many, if not all, of the code on this site has not been weather proofed or tested in the real world. It is indeed, 0xbadc0de.</p>
<p>The intension of this site is to provide myself with a memory of things i have learned as well as expose these concepts to the world in hopes that someone will find them benificial. Feel free to use anything you find on this site. If you would like more information or have ideas, <a href='/contact/index'>Please let me know<a>.</p>
